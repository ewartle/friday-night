Project Description: Are you willing to take a chance on your Friday Night?  If the answer is yes, this application is for you.
This application provides users with a unique and entertaining way to plan their Friday night.  Through a series of questions and/or inputs, this app will determine what users in the Atlanta area will do on a Friday night. The application will elicit the information that correlates to the search parameters in the EatStreet and Edamam APIs. The app provides the user with either a restaurant recommendation or a recipe recommendation (depending on whether the app determines that the user should stay in or go out) and an activity that corresponds with going out or staying in.  

This application utilizes the following:  HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, AJAX, APIs (Eatstreet & Edamam), JQuery, and Javascript.
